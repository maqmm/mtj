## Input structure

This script accepts .md or any text file as input. Each line in such a file is a menu element. Which element is nested in which is determined by the number of indents (`<\t>`), if there are 0 indents, you will see these elements when you open the menu, 1 indent will be nested in an element with 0 indentation higher in the file.

Let's examples:

```
A
B
C
D
```
The simplest menu of four elements that have no indents, all of which will appear when the menu starts.
